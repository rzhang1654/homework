4. modify notebook 
   I want to read from notebook.txt file when I list note(s)
   and I also want to save what I added or modified to notebook.txt file
   think about what you need to midify existing classes to achieve that and experiment it.
   you can play it anyway you want casue you already saved the working version in github master.
   push to development branch for interim deveopment code
